#+TITLE: Sesh Development Roadmap
#+AUTHOR: Marc Alvarez
#+DATE: [2025-04-19]

* Project Vision
Transform ~sesh~ from an AWS-specific MFA tool into a comprehensive, privacy-focused MFA management solution that works across terminal and web interfaces while keeping all secrets local.

** Open Source Philosophy
Sesh is open source with a plugin architecture designed for community contributions. Core functionality focuses on the maintainer's use cases (AWS, generic TOTP). Additional providers (GitHub, GCP, NPM, etc.) are welcome as community contributions. See docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md for guidance on adding new providers.

* Core Principles
- Privacy: All secrets remain local to the user's machine
- Security: Strong encryption and access controls via OS keychain
- Simplicity: Intuitive CLI interface with minimal setup
- Terminal-first: Designed for developer workflows

* Feature Roadmap

** Phase 1: Core Extension Framework [2/3]
*** DONE Multi-Service Plugin Architecture
**** Design plugin interface for multiple service providers
**** Create registration system for plugins
**** Implement service provider abstraction layer
**** Add ~--service~ flag for selecting providers

*** DONE Clipboard Integration [macOS only]
**** Add ~sesh clip~ command to copy TOTP to clipboard
**** Implement platform-specific clipboard handling (macOS/Linux/Windows)
**** Add optional notification for clipboard operations
**** Create configuration for auto-copying behavior

*** WONT Configuration System [Conflicts with explicit behavior philosophy]
**** ~~Create ~/.config/sesh directory for config files~~
**** ~~Implement YAML/TOML based configuration~~
**** ~~Add command-line options to override config~~
**** ~~Create ~sesh config~ subcommand~~

** Phase 2: Service Providers [2/2]
*** DONE AWS Provider (Existing)
**** Refactor current code as AWS plugin
**** Add AWS-specific configuration options
**** Maintain current functionality

*** DONE Generic TOTP Provider
**** Create configurable provider for arbitrary services
**** Support defining custom service names and configurations
**** Allow tagging and organizing services

** Phase 3: Terminal UI Enhancement [0/1]
*** TODO Interactive Terminal UI Mode
**** Create TUI for discovering and managing entries
**** Visual selection for passwords/TOTP entries  
**** Search-as-you-type functionality
**** Better UX for master password entry
**** Complement (not replace) existing CLI

** Phase 4: Advanced Features [0/4]
*** TODO Backup and Restore
**** Create secure export/import functionality
**** Support encrypted backup files
**** Document disaster recovery process

*** WONT Multi-Device Synchronization [Security complexity vs benefit]
**** ~~Design secure sync mechanism~~
**** ~~Document security considerations~~
**** ~~Implement sync via local network only~~

*** TODO Audit Logging
**** Track usage of TOTP codes
**** Log authentication attempts
**** Provide reports on service usage

*** WONT Advanced Configuration [Conflicts with simplicity principle]
**** ~~Support for custom TOTP parameters~~
**** ~~Allow different token validity periods~~
**** ~~Support for non-standard authentication flows~~

* Technical Tasks

** Core Infrastructure [2/3]
*** DONE Refactor existing code into plugins
*** DONE Create plugin loading system
*** WONT Implement configuration manager [Using explicit flags instead]

** Security Enhancements [3/3]
*** DONE Audit keychain usage
*** DONE Implement strict permission checks
*** DONE Add TOTP seed validation

** Testing [4/4]
*** DONE Create automated tests for plugins
*** DONE Implement CI pipeline
*** DONE Add security testing [gosec via make security-scan]
*** DONE Create integration tests with actual services [AWS implemented]

** Documentation [3/3]
*** DONE Update README with new capabilities
*** DONE Create plugin development guide
*** DONE Improve security documentation

* Testing Notes:

-- RESOLVED: Delete functionality now implemented with --delete flag
---- Scenario: I deleted my virtual MFA device in AWS, but the keychain entry is still there
---- When I run sesh next, I get:

```shell
‚ùØ sesh
üîê Activating AWS session with MFA...
üîê Generating temporary credentials with MFA...
‚ùå failed to get session token: failed to run aws sts get-session-token: exit status 254
Args: [sts get-session-token --serial-number arn:aws:iam::314904127601:mfa/sesh-updated-4-19 --token-code 915080 --output json]
Stderr:
An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the GetSessionToken operation: MultiFactorAuthentication failed, unable to validate MFA code.  Please verify your MFA serial number is valid and associated with this user.


Troubleshooting tips:
  1. Verify your AWS credentials are correctly configured:
     - Run 'aws configure' to set up your access keys
     - Check that the AWS_PROFILE environment variable is set correctly
  2. Verify your MFA serial ARN is correct:
     - Specify it with --serial arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:mfa/YOUR_USERNAME
     - Or set the SESH_MFA_SERIAL environment variable
  3. Check AWS CLI installation and connectivity:
     - Ensure you can run 'aws sts get-caller-identity'
‚úÖ AWS session activated
```
