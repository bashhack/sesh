# sesh ‚Äî An extensible terminal-first authentication toolkit for secure credential workflows

> A powerful CLI tool that manages secure authentication workflows for AWS, TOTP services, and beyond. Built with an extensible plugin architecture, sesh provides seamless credential management with macOS Keychain integration.

## üéØ Purpose

I was tired of relying on browser extensions or native desktop apps from corporate vendors‚Äîtools that often feel like security theater while quietly harvesting data. I needed something lightweight, security-conscious, and that respects user privacy.

In particular, I wanted fast, secure MFA support directly in the terminal‚Äîboth for AWS console access and for web-based TOTP forms. I was frustrated by how tightly MFA workflows are coupled to mobile devices, and I wanted to break free from that dependency.

**sesh fills that gap.** It's simple, scriptable, and works seamlessly for both:
- AWS CLI + console MFA workflows
- Web-based MFA flows where a TOTP secret is available

While sesh overlaps a bit with tools like aws-vault, it goes further by offering a general-purpose CLI-based TOTP experience‚Äîno mobile device, no browser, no bloat. Your security, your control, your terminal.

## üåü Features

- **Extensible Plugin Architecture** ‚Äî Easy to add new authentication providers
-Ô∏è **Secure by Design** ‚Äî All secrets stored in macOS Keychain with binary-level access control
- **Terminal-First Workflow** ‚Äî Optimized for developers who live in the terminal
- **Smart TOTP Handling** ‚Äî Generates current and next codes, handles edge cases automatically
- **Intelligent Subshell** ‚Äî Isolated credential environments with built-in helper commands
- **QR Code Scanning** ‚Äî Set up TOTP services directly from screenshots
- **Multiple Profile Support** ‚Äî Manage dev/prod environments and multiple accounts per service

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Option 1: Install with Homebrew (macOS)
brew install bashhack/sesh/sesh
# Note: Homebrew automatically adds sesh to your PATH, so it's ready to use immediately

# Option 2: Install using Go (requires Go 1.24+)
go install github.com/bashhack/sesh/cmd/sesh@latest
# Note: Ensure your Go bin directory (typically $HOME/go/bin) is in your PATH
# You can add this to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):
# export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin

# Option 3: Download pre-built binary
# Visit: https://github.com/bashhack/sesh/releases
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

You can start benefiting from `sesh` by first setting up your first provider entry.

### üßô Setup Wizards

Each available `--setup` guides you through configuration for a given provider:

```bash
# Setup AWS MFA
sesh --service aws --setup

# Setup TOTP service
sesh --service totp --setup
```

Features:
- QR code scanning via screenshot
- Manual secret entry fallback
- Automatic secret validation
- Step-by-step instructions


## üéØ Usage Guide

### Available Service Providers

#### AWS Provider (`--service aws`)
Manages AWS CLI authentication with MFA support. By default, launches a secure subshell with temporary credentials.

```bash
# Access provider-specific help
sesh -service aws -help

# Launch secure subshell (default)
sesh --service aws

# Copy TOTP code(s) for AWS Web Console
sesh --service aws --clip

# Use specific AWS profile
sesh --service aws --profile production

# Print credentials instead of subshell
sesh --service aws --no-subshell

# List all AWS entries
sesh --service aws --list

# Delete an AWS entry
sesh --service aws --delete <entry-id>
```

#### TOTP Provider (`--service totp`)
Generic TOTP provider for any service (GitHub, Google, Slack, etc.).

```bash
# Access provider-specific help
sesh -service totp -help

# Copy code to clipboard
sesh --service totp --service-name github --clip

# Use specific profile (for multiple accounts)
sesh --service totp --service-name github --profile work

# List all TOTP entries
sesh --service totp --list

# Delete a TOTP entry
sesh -service totp -delete <entry-id>
```

### üêö Subshell Features (AWS)

When you run `sesh --service aws`, you enter a secure subshell with:

#### Visual Indicators
- Custom prompt showing active sesh session
- Credential expiry countdown
- Visual confirmation of secure environment

#### Built-in Commands
- `sesh_status` ‚Äî Show session details and test AWS connection
- `verify_aws` ‚Äî Quick AWS authentication check
- `sesh_help` ‚Äî Display available subshell commands
- `exit` or `Ctrl+D` ‚Äî Leave the secure environment

#### Environment Variables
- `SESH_ACTIVE=1` ‚Äî Indicates active sesh session
- `SESH_SERVICE=aws` ‚Äî Current service provider
- `SESH_EXPIRY` ‚Äî Unix timestamp of credential expiration
- Standard AWS credential variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, etc.)


### üìã Entry Management

List and manage stored credentials:

```bash
# List all entries for a service
sesh --service aws --list
sesh --service totp --list

# Delete specific entry
sesh --service aws --delete <entry-id>
sesh --service totp --delete <entry-id>
```

### üéØ Command Reference

#### Global Options
