# Sesh Feature Ideas

This document outlines potential features to enhance sesh while maintaining its core philosophy of simplicity and explicit behavior.

## Priority Features

### Shell Completions
- Automatic completion for bash/zsh/fish
- Complete service names, commands, and flags
- Context-aware suggestions

### Terminal UI Mode
- Interactive interface for discovering and managing entries
- Visual selection for passwords/TOTP entries
- Search-as-you-type functionality
- Batch operations (select multiple entries)
- Better UX for master password entry
- Complement (not replace) existing CLI

### Database-Backed Password Manager
- See `PURE_GO_SQLITE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for detailed implementation
- Provides foundation for many other features:
  - Configuration storage
  - Backup/restore functionality
  - Audit logging capabilities
  - Cross-platform portability

## Potential Provider Expansions

### Multi-provider Support (Low Priority)
- Support for other cloud providers (GCP, Azure)
- Only if there's clear user demand
- Would leverage existing provider abstraction

## User Experience Goals

- Make common tasks faster while maintaining explicit behavior
- Reduce cognitive load without adding hidden complexity
- Maintain strong security defaults
- Provide clear, helpful error messages
- Keep the tool simple and focused on terminal workflows
